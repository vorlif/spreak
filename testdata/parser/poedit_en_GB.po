#. TRANSLATORS: This is a somewhat common term describing the action where
#. you apply the translation memory and/or machine translation to all of the
#. strings you're translating as the first step, followed by correcting,
#. improving etc., i.e. actually translating the strings. This may be tricky
#. to express in other languages as simply as in English, but please try to
#. keep it similarly concise. Please try to avoid, if possible, describing it
#. as "auto-translation" and similar, because such terminology would mislead
#. some users into thinking it's all that needs to be done (spoken from
#. experience). "Pre-translate" nicely expresses that it's only the step done
#. *before* actual translation.
